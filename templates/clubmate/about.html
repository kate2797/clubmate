        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Going clubbing during your university years can be very enjoyable but also risky. How does one know if
                the new club in the town is good? Club ratings to the rescue.
                The aim of ClubMate is to help guide rave-seeking freshers and the student population more broadly
                through a plethora of venues and clubs throughout the UK not only to get their money's worth, but also
                ensure they are clubbing safely. Students will have to create an account to be able to leave ratings for
                clubs and vote for existing ratings.
            </p>
            <p>ClubMate also intends to help club owners get their clubs noticed
                amid the losses from the pandemic. Club owners can list their venues on ClubMate and include venue
                address, opening times, a small
                description of the bar and where it is on a map, so that students can easily choose the venue of their
                choice for the night.
            </p>
            <p>Students can browse and select clubs depending on their location, genre, and criteria such as whether
                18+ entry or COVID test are required, user reviews of the venues in terms of the clubâ€™s number of stars,
                user commentary, and whether a club is deemed safe by others. Through its focus on student health
                safety, ClubMate brings a new spin-off to traditional club rating applications.
